I started my coding journey back in 2016 when I got introduced to the C++ programming language for the very first time. I had chosen Computer Science as one of the subjects back then. In just a few weeks, I realized that coding is for me and vice-versa. I am quite fond of maths and coding to me feels like math in action.

Python and C++ are currently my favorite programming languages. I am fond of competitive coding and I do regularly participate in contests on codeforces and leetcode. I am currently pretty weak but I am trying my best to improve. On a side note, I am a hardcore hashmap fan and I find them extremely fascinating. I do like building hobby projects and have decent experience in Machine Learning.
